        The exact size and complexity of the management team for gaming events
        can vary widely. Smaller events may have a relatively small team or even
        be managed by a single person, while larger events like major gaming
        conventions require a much larger and specialized team. Additionally,
        event management companies may be hired to handle various aspects of
        event planning and execution. Overall, the management of gaming events
        is a multifaceted process that requires careful planning, coordination,
        and attention to detail to create successful and memorable experiences
        for attendees and participants.
